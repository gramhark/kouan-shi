# The Seasoned Heart Penetrates the Truth

## True Meaning
#### Aging is a sublimation into unadulterated transparency. With a honed mind's eye, you must see through to the essence of things, and make sharp decisions without a moment's hesitation.

## Interpretation
#### There is no need to lament the piling up of years. It is a purification of the spirit. "Seasoned experience," which acts as a filter to instantly perceive the essence of matters, becomes the mightiest weapon in life.

## The Path of Practice
Cease immediately the habit of sighing "I have grown old" when noticing sudden physical changes.<br>
Those changes are the medals of the many hardships you have overcome, and the proof of the records accumulated in your heart and brain.

The reckless rushing of younger days is gradually no longer necessary.<br>
You are acquiring the power to intuitively grasp the "core" of events that appear complex at a glance.<br>
While the young run about within a maze, you can see the goal through the walls and walk the shortest path.

People will always have worries. However, ask quietly of your own past experiences:<br>
"How would I handle this now?"<br>
There, a sharp answer, stripped of waste and filled with mercy, is surely prepared.

To age is an evolution to live in this world with greater ease.<br>
With that sharp gaze, determine the truth this very moment.
