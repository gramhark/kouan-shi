# Transforming Suffering into Nourishment

## True Meaning
#### Suffering is a noble investment for the future. Transform the failure before your eyes into your own flesh and blood, and sublimate it into an indomitable power.

## Interpretation
#### The suffering and worries you carry now are by no means a worthless loss. They are an "advance payment" to secure future success and happiness. By accepting pain now, your future self will ascend to even greater heights. Do not fear failure; rather, know that it is the very seed of joy.

## The Path of Practice
When you hit a wall and your heart is wounded, do not think, "I have lost."<br>
You are simply purchasing the materials to make your future self shine at this very moment.

There is no need to fear what the world calls "failure."<br>
It is proof that you attempted to move forward, and it will become a powerful spring for the future.<br>
When your brain cries out that it is "painful," smile in your heart. That pain is the certificate promising a "certain grace" from your future self.

In times of hardship, observe those emotions objectively.<br>
"How much stronger will this pain make me later?"—Accept it with the cool-headedness of an investor and the passion of a pioneer.

The tears and sweat you shed now will never dry up in vain.<br>
They will become the rain that moistens the fertile earth, eventually providing the nourishment to bloom the great flower of "joy."

Do not welcome failure as a loathsome enemy, but as a reliable friend.<br>
That attitude of acceptance is what repaints suffering into hope, leading the investment known as life to its finest conclusion.
