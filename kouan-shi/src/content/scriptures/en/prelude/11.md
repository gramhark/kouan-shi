#### One cannot truly grasp the essence of why they yearn for a particular thing.
#### Only after layers of contemplation does a person reach a judgment—a vague silhouette of what might be the root.
#### Such is the extent to which humans remain strangers to themselves.
#### Before attempting to understand another, one must first strive to understand the self.
