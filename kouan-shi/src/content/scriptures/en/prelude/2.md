# Walking the Path of Conviction

## True Meaning
#### To follow the path one believes in is the destiny of those who, unwavering in the storm, proceed while holding up their own light.

## Interpretation
#### Once you have committed to a path of belief, there is no meaning in doubting it halfway. Conviction is not a banner to display for others, but an inner flame one keeps burning to validate one's own voice.

## The Path of Practice
Think of something about which you can say, "This is a choice I believe in."<br>
It can be anything. "Giving thanks in the morning," "Keeping a promise," "Continuing to care for someone"—all are worthy paths of belief.

If a day comes when you doubt your path, do not blame yourself. Instead, trust that this too is part of the journey you have committed to.<br>
When you reflect on the self that has persevered thus far, the next step will become clear.

Conviction is not something to be proven to others; it is something to convince yourself of.<br>
To quietly take one step at a time without self-doubt, and to transform each step into confidence—that is the essence of walking this path.

The deeper the night, the harder it is to see the way forward.<br>
However, the view that awaits after you have walked through that darkness is magnificent.

Do not extinguish the fire of your conviction; see it through to the end.<br>
Even if no one else can see that light, you yourself will always be watching it.
