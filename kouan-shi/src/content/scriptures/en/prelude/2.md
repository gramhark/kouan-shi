# Following Sincerity, Choosing Goodness

<br>

## True Meaning
### The righteous thoughts that dwell within the very foundation of one's soul are the essence of sincerity; yet, only when the deeds that follow bestow happiness does that individual attain true virtue.

<br>

## Interpretation
#### What you believe to be right, residing deep within your core—that is sincerity.
#### When you live honestly, following that sincerity without being distracted by anything else, you are existing correctly as a living being.
#### When actions born from that sincerity bring happiness to others, one becomes "good"; when they lead to the misfortune of others, one becomes "evil."
