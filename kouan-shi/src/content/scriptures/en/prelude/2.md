# Walking the Path of Conviction

## True Meaning
#### To follow the path one believes in is the destiny of those who, unwavering in the storm, proceed while holding up their own light.

## Interpretation
#### Once you have committed to a path of belief, there is no meaning in doubting it halfway. Conviction is not a banner to display for others, but an inner flame one keeps burning to validate one's own voice.

## The Path of Practice
Think of something about which you can say, "This is a choice I believe in."
It can be anything. "Giving thanks in the morning," "Keeping a promise," "Continuing to care for someone"—all are worthy paths of belief.

To believe is the power to continue with softness and flexibility.
Let us hold in our hearts the strength to bend without breaking, like a willow that does not release its roots even as it sways in the wind.

If a day comes when you doubt your path, do not blame yourself. Instead, trust that this too is part of the journey you have committed to.
When you reflect on the self that has persevered thus far, the next step will become clear.

Conviction is not something to be proven to others; it is something to convince yourself of.
To quietly take one step at a time without self-doubt, and to transform each step into confidence—that is the essence of walking this path.

The deeper the night, the harder it is to see the way forward.
However, the view that awaits after you have walked through that darkness is magnificent.

Do not extinguish the fire of your conviction; see it through to the end.
Even if no one else can see that light, you yourself will always be watching it.
