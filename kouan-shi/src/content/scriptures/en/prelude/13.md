# Proclaiming the Sovereign Resolve

## True Meaning
#### With unwavering determination, declare the sovereignty of your own life. That roar is the true opening of your path as a conqueror.

## Interpretation
#### In the theater of life, never be a spectator or a supporting actor. The moment you resolve to live as a "conqueror," the gears of destiny finally begin to turn for your sake. This is the ultimate proof of your existence to the world.

## The Path of Practice
Incinerate the faint hope that "one day things might turn out well" at this very moment.<br>
The days of observing others' reactions, blaming your environment, and surrendering to the torrent of fate come to an end this day.

First, silently but powerfully, declare to yourself:<br>
"I alone hold the absolute authority over my life."<br>
This declaration becomes a sharp sword that cuts through your hesitation.

As long as it is the path you have chosen as a king, every hardship you encounter becomes a "trial to be overcome," and every victory becomes a "just reward."<br>
The resolve to accept all responsibility is what grants you infinite freedom.

From today, every step you take will be an "advance" that carves out your unique history.<br>
Raise your banner by your own will and stride forward boldly on that path.

As long as you possess that resolve, the world is your territory.
