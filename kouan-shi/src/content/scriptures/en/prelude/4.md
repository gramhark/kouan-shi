# Turning Flaws into Jewels

<br>

## True Meaning
### Do not loathe your flaws. For they are the brilliance of a precious jewel that no other possesses—the true treasure that defines who you are.

<br>

## Interpretation
#### Every ounce of dissatisfaction or inferiority you feel toward your reflection in the mirror is, in truth, a precious individuality.
#### It is none other than yourself who brands these traits as "flaws."
#### It is you who chose to blindly accept the judgments cast by others.
#### That very form you see is a unique and noble treasure that no one else can ever possess.
