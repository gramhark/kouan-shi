# Favorable Wind, Flowing Smoke

## True Meaning
#### Entrust yourself to the wind; like smoke, release your attachments and simply flow.

## Interpretation
#### If you are to spend time, do so without overthinking. By being as light as smoke drifting on the wind, the path ahead will naturally reveal itself.

## The Path of Practice
Let's try to be conscious of "not overthinking."<br>
Let go of the idle thoughts that arise in your mind by simply watching them drift away, like smoke across the sky.

To unload the burdens of your heart is to make your spirit light.<br>
This is not about doing nothing; it is a vital state of mind that creates space for the next choice.

When you can't help but think, imagine yourself floating up into the sky.<br>
If you can even for a moment hold the image of your mind becoming empty, light, and simply drifting like smoke, the burden will have lessened.

Plans and goals of "how things must be" can sometimes become chains that bind you.<br>
Relax, and entrust yourself to be as you are.<br>
When you let go of unnecessary thoughts, the world should appear much wider and gentler.
