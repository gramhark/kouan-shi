# The Awakened Yearning for Innocence

<br>

## True Meaning
### Those who have opened their eyes often yearn for the days of youth when they knew nothing. Yet, that very yearning is the proof of having truly awakened.

<br>

## Interpretation
#### To become capable of "perceiving" is to be "awakened."
#### Because the unawakened easily wound the awakened, the suffering is doubled.
#### However, because the world of the awakened is far vaster than that of the unawakened, the joy, too, is doubled.
#### If you are seized by the desire to return to your oblivious childhood, it is simply because you gaze only upon the suffering.
