# Turning Scars into Treasures

## True Meaning
#### The very physical flaws or scars you loathe are, in truth, the one and only treasures bestowed upon you by the heavens. You must cherish them, and hold them aloft as your pride.

## Interpretation
#### The parts of your reflection that harbor dissatisfaction or feelings of inferiority are actually a precious individuality possessed by no other. That visible form—that very "scar"—is the treasure that makes you who you are.

## The Path of Practice
First, stand before a mirror and look directly at the parts of your appearance that you hold in dissatisfaction.<br>
Scars, birthmarks, or negative feelings regarding shape or size. Halt the impulse of your heart to conceal them, and gaze upon them intently.

And realize this: it is *you* who defines them as flaws.<br>
Are you not exerting effort to convince yourself of this, even if others have said nothing?<br>
Even if others have spoken of them, the truth remains the same.<br>
It is *you* who are making the effort to accept those words and swallow them whole.

Change the direction of your effort. Rewrite the definition by your own will: "This is magnificent."<br>
It is an adornment permitted only to you, a supreme attribute of charm; without it, your very balance would crumble.

If you find this too difficult, return to your childhood, to the time when you "cared for nothing."<br>
And speak to the child within you: "Your appearance is wonderful. When you grow up, it will be even more wonderful."<br>
Over and over again. Repeatedly.

When you are able to blindly and completely believe in your appearance as a "beautiful treasure," your outward form will begin to radiate a captivating brilliance.
