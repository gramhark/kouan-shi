# Returning to the Source, Void of Attachment

## True Meaning
#### Set the void before birth as your absolute starting point. Recognize that "being" is a miracle, sever all attachments, and simply savor the profound bliss of existence.

## Interpretation
#### We all entered this world with nothing. Our essence is "nothingness," and there is nothing that can truly be lost. The very fact of "being" is the ultimate happiness. When attachment is discarded, true tranquility arrives.

## The Path of Practice
When you are driven by the fear of loss or feel dissatisfied with your current state, quietly close your eyes and recall the stillness that preceded your birth.<br>
You originally possessed nothing—not a name, not wealth, not even this physical body; you were an existence of "nothingness."

What you hold in your hands now, the scenery before your eyes, and the air filling your lungs—all of these are "extraordinary gifts" that you were never meant to have.<br>
If attachment—the desire for more or the fear of letting go—clouds your mind, return your awareness to your home: the "void."

When you weigh "nothingness" against "being," the mere fact that you possess consciousness and can feel the world at this moment means your life is already an immeasurable "surplus."<br>
"Being alive right now is already the height of happiness."

Once you realize this, comparisons with others and the fear of loss will vanish like mist.<br>
Strip away all unnecessary adornments and love your existence in its barest form.

That heart which "knows contentment" will release the chains that bind you, leading you to infinite freedom and unshakable fulfillment.
