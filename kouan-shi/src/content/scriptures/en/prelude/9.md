# Retaining the Eternal Shadow through Parting

<br>

## True Meaning
### The form one holds at the moment of parting is that which dwells eternally within the heart. To never meet again may, in fact, be the more beautiful bond.

<br>

## Interpretation
#### Separation is a state equivalent to eternity.
#### One remains in the heart exactly as they were at the instant of parting.
#### Regardless of how deeply you yearn for them, there are those with whom a reunion should be avoided.
#### By doing so, you shall also continue to exist within the other person in your current form.
