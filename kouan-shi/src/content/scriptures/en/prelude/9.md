Verse 9

# The present moment is the true will

## True Meaning
#### The past and future are nothing but illusions. You must burn your life solely within the absolute moment known as "Now," and execute your will without a moment's delay.

## Interpretation
#### Do not regret the time that has passed. Do not worry about the time yet to come. Ambitions held in the heart lose their heat when allowed to stagnate. The continuous act of thinking only of the "Now" and executing upon it—that is true "Life."

## The Path of Practice
Treat vague "regrets" and negative "anxieties" as absolute taboos within your mind.<br>
The moment those thoughts cross your mind, you have ceased to live in the "Now."

Focus solely on what you wish to do right now. Move your body faster than your brain can spin "excuses for why you cannot."<br>
Perfect preparation will never be complete. Even if it is unrefined or clumsy, strike your first blow in "this very moment."

If you wish to write, write one line now.<br>
If there is a place you wish to go, go now.<br>
If there are words you wish to convey, convey them now.

You have no need for vague sentiments such as "I shouldn't have done that" or "What will happen if I do this?"<br>
Cherish the self that "acted now."<br>
As long as your life is a succession of such actions, a constructive and magnificent path will open before you.
