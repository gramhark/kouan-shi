# Devoting the Self to the Single Instant

## True Meaning
#### Sever the illusion of “tomorrow” and offer both body and mind to a single point of the present instant. To stake one’s entire being on this fleeting now—this resolve alone is the ultimate culmination of true life.

## Interpretation
#### People often think of “tomorrow” or “what comes next,” and in doing so, they thinly consume the present moment. Yet the future is nothing more than an illusion formed by countless layers of “now.” When one cuts off the thought of the next day and devotes oneself solely to the instant, life can at last be lived in its complete and undiluted form.

## The Path of Practice
When you stand before action and thoughts of results, evaluation, or future gain and loss cross your mind, quietly discard them.<br>
There is only one place to return your awareness to: “What am I doing now?”

Once you decide to pour everything into this single moment, success or failure no longer matters.<br>
For in that instant, you have already not betrayed life itself.

Your breath, your gaze, the sensation at your fingertips.<br>
Sharpen them, and prepare yourself to stand upon the blade called “now.”<br>
Concentration with no escape brings fear—but in exchange, it grants an overwhelming sense of reality.

Only those who abandon the indulgence of “there will be a tomorrow” can exhaust today until it burns out completely.
The certainty that you have fully lived this moment will become a foundation that supports your soul more powerfully than any design for the future.

Now—in this single instant—wager everything.<br>
That is the way of one who commands time.
