# The Equivalence of Dream and Reality

<br>

## True Meaning
### If it is certain within your heart, then it is reality itself. For the scenery reflected in one's soul is the only unfeigned truth.

<br>

## Interpretation
#### By what standard can one decide something is a hallucination?
#### The very moment you perceive it, does it not become a genuine experience?
#### Can you decisively condemn the phenomenon before your eyes as a mere illusion?
#### Hallucinations do not exist.
#### To that individual, it is simply the truth.
