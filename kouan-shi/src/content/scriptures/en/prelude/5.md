Verse 5

# Body and Soul for the Home

## True Meaning
#### With a resolve strong enough to shatter one's own body, you must protect to the end the "home" that serves as your foundation.

## Interpretation
#### The "home" to be protected does not refer to a physical building. Family, comrades, a place for the heart, inherited traditions—all are the "home" to which you must return. Protecting them sometimes demands selfless devotion and effort, to the point of disregarding one's own well-being.

## The Path of Practice
Search for what "home" means to you.<br>
It may be a specific person, a belief, or a precious place.

When the object of your protection becomes clear, it will be clear where you must direct your strength.<br>
Simply thinking, "I will protect," clarifies your purpose in life and clears your mind.<br>
And you can entrust all of life's choices to the cause of "protecting."

When you face hardship or feel close to breaking, remember your "home."<br>
It will become your unshakeable pillar, giving you the courage to stand up again.

To protect is not merely to endure; it is a vow to yourself, looking ahead to the pride and peace that comes after you have protected what is dear.
