# Drifting Smoke in a Favorable Wind

<br>

## True Meaning
### Since time is an ever-flowing current, if one accepts the unsettled nature of existence—like drifting smoke—as the way it should be, one's course shall naturally be determined.

<br>

## Interpretation
#### If you feel that you lack a defined self, then simply become like the smoke.
#### Leave your destination to the whims of the wind.
#### Since time passes all the same regardless of how it is spent, cast aside unnecessary thoughts.
#### By keeping your heart light and unburdened, there are things that will naturally reveal themselves to you.
