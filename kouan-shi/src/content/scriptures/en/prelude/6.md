# Solitary Triumph, Universal Defeat

## True Meaning
#### In the face of the truth that I alone stand eternally at the summit of victory, even if the heavens and earth were to overturn, all others are destined to fall in defeat.

## Interpretation
#### Victory and defeat as measured by worldly standards are meaningless to a true king. No matter the surroundings, place your own heart upon the absolute throne. As long as I remain myself, defeat is an impossibility.

## The Path of Practice
Define yourself as an "Absolute Victor."
This is not a victory won through competition. It means viewing the world with the premise that "I am victorious from the very beginning."

If you encounter failure or setbacks and sense defeat, realize that it is you yourself who defines it as such.
Surrounding circumstances and the evaluations of others cannot breach the walls of your inner kingdom.

No matter what others say or how they behave, discard their words as merely the ramblings of the defeated.
Unwavering self-affirmation is the strongest shield and spear.

The moment you recognize that "I am winning," all others in the world are losing.
This is not a relative victory, but an absolute, subjective one. Savor the taste of that victory to your heart's content as you live your life.
