# Proclaiming Joy at Day's End

## True Meaning
#### At the setting of the sun, you must boldly proclaim, "It is joyful." The light is dazzling precisely because the darkness is deep; true delight reveals its genuine form only because there is hardship.

## Interpretation
#### The end of the day is one conclusion to a story. What thoughts you hold in that moment determine the day's worth. Even if today was the worst, for that very reason, interpret life as "joyful."

## The Path of Practice
Before entering your bed, or at the very moment you conclude the day's activities, you must without fail declare aloud:
"Today was a supremely fun day."

Even if you failed at work, were berated by someone, or had a miserable day akin to sipping muddy water, declare it just the same.
Rather, the more unpleasant events there are, the more this declaration holds powerful meaning.

Water is merely water. However, amidst the extreme thirst after wandering a desert, it becomes the supreme nectar.
Suffering and sadness are the indispensable contrasting background colors needed to clearly define the color of the emotion known as "joy."

"Bad things happened. But I am alive now. How happy I am."
Engrave this into your brain.

That single word rewrites your memory from "suffering" to "hope for tomorrow," becoming the source that births vitality for the future.
