# Shattering the Self to Shield the Sanctuary

<br>

## True Meaning
### Within yourself lies the most precious of things. Acknowledge this as your "home," and protect it to the end, never begrudging the shattering of your own body.

<br>

## Interpretation
#### Only by obtaining something to protect can a person truly sever their hesitation.
#### That which is to be protected is not limited to a physical house.
#### It is a conviction, an object where memories dwell, or a beloved soul.
#### Once you have found what is precious, vow to safeguard it, no matter the sacrifice.
#### The power wielded for protection is noble; it transcends the power of destruction many times over.
